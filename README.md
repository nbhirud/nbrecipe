I do not know how I am going to structure this. Need to figure this out. The thought that this should rather be on git came to my mind when I was trying to sleep yesterday night, and today I thought that I should at least create a placeholder git repository so that this good idea doesn't get lost.

I know that most chefs won't be using git. But I am a programmer first then anything else by profession. And I think having contributions or peer reviews from cooking enthusiasts who are into even little bit of coding or non coders who make an effort to learn git basics is good enough.

I first thought of creating a blog or adding it to my personal website, but then it misses the point of peer reviews and contributions.
